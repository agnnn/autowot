AutoWoT is a program that allows tech-savvy end-users and developers to rapidly and conveniently integrate smart devices into the Web of Things. To do this, users utilize AutoWoT's drag&drop interface to create a resource-oriented description of any smart thing that is to be web-enabled. AutoWoT then automatically creates web server software from that description thereby exposing the device's functionality on the web and making it accessible to millions of users.

  * Fast and easy integration of devices and services into the Web
  * REST-compliant resource-oriented architectures
  * Authentication (HTTP Basic/Digest) on resource- and request method-level
